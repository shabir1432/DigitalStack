**Prediction #2: A Surprise Goalscorer**

Forget Kane and Haaland. A lesser-known player will step up and find the back of the net. Think a defender heading in a set-piece or a midfielder unleashing a screamer from outside the box. Maybe Richarlison gets his chance to shine!

Tensions will be high, and a rash challenge will result in a red card. This could drastically change the game's dynamic. Who will it be? Our money is on a late, frustrated tackle.

The game will be decided by a penalty in the final 10 minutes. Pressure will be immense, and the outcome will hang in the balance. Can the penalty taker handle the heat?

**Prediction #5: Man City to Win, But It Will Be Close**

Despite a valiant effort from Tottenham, Man City's quality will shine through. They'll secure a narrow 2-1 victory, but it won't be easy.
