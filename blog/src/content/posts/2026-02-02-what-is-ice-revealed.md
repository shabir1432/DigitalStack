## What is Ice? The Basic Definition

At its core, ice is water in a solid state. It forms when the temperature of water drops to 0°C (32°F) or below. But "what is ice" beyond just frozen water? It's a crystalline structure where water molecules are arranged in a specific pattern, creating a less dense substance than liquid water (which is why ice floats!). The arrangement of molecules in ice is what gives it its unique properties, like its ability to reflect sunlight and insulate bodies of water. The process of ice formation is a fascinating example of phase transition, where a substance changes from one state (liquid) to another (solid).

**Key Takeaway:** ICE stands for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

## What is Ice Melt and How Does it Work?

"What is ice melt" is a product used to lower the freezing point of water, preventing ice formation or melting existing ice. Common ice melt products include rock salt (sodium chloride), calcium chloride, and magnesium chloride. These substances work by dissolving in water and interfering with the hydrogen bonds that form ice crystals. Understanding "what is ice melt" and how it works is crucial for winter safety and preventing slips and falls.
